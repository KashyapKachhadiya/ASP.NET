        CHARUSAT believes in the principles of Honesty, Integrity and Transparency. 
        The University aims to provide a harmonic environment to all the students, employees, 
        associates and stakeholders. To facilitate these, various cells at 
        University are established like Grievance Redressal Cell, Equal Opportunity Cell, 
        Women Development Cell, Cell for Prevention of Sexual Harassment and Anti-Ragging Cell. 
        Any stakeholder who finds any discrepancy under the aegis of different cells can use
