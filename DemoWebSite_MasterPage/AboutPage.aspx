        Intelligence with Character is the true goal of Education. 
        Knowledge gives humility, from humility, one attains Character. 
        The Highest Education is that which makes our life in harmony with all existence. 
        In the context, CHARUSAT as a University has been quite distinct from day one. 
        It strives to make Charotar – 
        the Land of Sardar Patel the Global Education Hub through knowledge creation, 
        augmentation, and dissemination. For the purpose, CHARUSAT dedicates its efforts towards 
        developing synergy between industry and academia; and community upliftment through education. 
        Importantly, CHARUSAT continually strives to focus on the future with an entrepreneurial spirit.
        As a University, CHARUSAT is emerging with a thrust on socially relevant Research & Development. 
        For the purpose, a Research and Development Centre has been established on the Campus. 
        Uniquely, Space Research and Technology Centre is also established to initiate and foster 
        research in Space Technology.Efforts are also made for education amelioration in rural schools 
        through a Rural Education Development Program.On-Campus and Outreach Activities are organized 
        for School – Students, Teachers, and Management. Human Resource Development Centre hones 
        competencies of Faculty and Staff on Campus.Through these initiatives and practices, 
        CHARUSAT focuses on converting eyes into sight and vision; information into 
        knowledge and wisdom; and students / individuals into citizens and harmonious living. 
        Further, programs at CHARUSAT enable the students not only to gain an understanding 
        but also to develop insights in altered research areas. Teachers also dedicate their 
        efforts to construct and facilitate opportunities where the students can practice and 
        experience creativity. Moving a step ahead towards the purpose of education, CHARUSAT 
        aims to make its students Job Creators and not Job Seekers.In order to inculcate values 
        in the students, CHARUSAT has been established as a University fostering High Moral Values. 
        Honesty, Integrity, and Transparency have been the benchmarks of CHARUSAT in both – word 
        and action.In the journey, CHARUSAT fosters a niche for a world-class education at the rural base. 
        It aspires to be a World Class University. Primarily, it strives to be among 
        Top 20 Universities at National Level.I, earnestly, request you all to join hands with 
        CHARUSAT and work towards the realization of this aspiration. Many have already volunteered 
        in this Seva Yagna through their magnanimity, knowledge, skills and resource sharing; and 
        through their association with CHARUSAT either as a Faculty, Staff or Student.On behalf of 
        CHARUSAT Family, I extend a word of gratitude to all and also invite all to visit the Campus, 
        witness the development and be a part of the Journey.
        <br /><br />
